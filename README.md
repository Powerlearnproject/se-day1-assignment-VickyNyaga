#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
soft ware engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with design,development,testing and maintanance of software applications.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
web applications like fb ,whatsup, telegram

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. planning: involves the descrption of the purposes and scope of the development
2. requirements; understanding the needs of the end user for easy compatability.
3. design: the software development team designd its application in a way users wont strain using it.
4. coding : the software team get down to busines and descibe the design into tangible code to a functional unit.
5. testmg: a thorough inspection on quality and functionality of the product.
6. development : launching the product and service to the user
7. maintance: by checking on the system to ensure functionality and to follow up on clients reviews and feedbacks
   

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall method uses linear methodologies that are rigid phases that is when one phase ends the next step begins and does not allow developers to go back eg supply chain management systems and inventory management systems Agle methodologies values flexibility and customer satisfaction eg adaptive software development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer is responsible for writing the code and developing the entie software product and sending updates to the project manager and working closely with other rteam membersincluding the designer and QA engineer.

QA engineer is responsible for creating test thagt identify issues with softwares before being deployed, monitors every phase of the software development porocess and ensures quality is maintained at ever stage of the development process and the final produt meets the requirements.

Project manager overseees the planning,execution and delivery of the software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES  converts codes into a simplied language that the operating system can understand eg cloud ide
VCS  streamline the development process, enabling faster iteration and deliver features EG SNV 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a)rapid changes in techonology: one can mitigate this by ensuring the engineers are well versed with the changing technologies.
b) lack of workflow visibility: vague understanding of the prject teams leads to poor visibility thus one can mitigate this using project management tools.
c)consumer demands can be a challenge especially if the do not know how to specify there needs clearly thus to mitigate this engineers
 should under consumer need 
d) time constraints and resources : ensuring that the project team is given enough time and resource to meet demands of the users


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing are low and  close to the source of application and consist in testing individual methods and functions of componenents used by the software

integration testing: verify different modules or services used by application work together.

system tests focus on the business requirements  of an application and only verify the output of an action

acceptantance tests verifys if a system satisfies business equirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

PROMPT engineering is a commmand or message displayed by a computer indicating a system is ready to receive input and is important to assist organisations to optimize how users use AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt: what is the weather today
